# Axial LOB: High Frequency Trading with Axial Attention
In this repository is implemented the pytorch implementation of the paper [Axial LOB: High Frequency Trading with Axial Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01807.pdf).

To run the code you just have to download the [FI-2010 dataset](https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/73eb48d7-4dbc-4a10-a52a-da745b47a649/data) and to change the data path, then the notebook will do the rest, including the training and testing.
